                        <h2 class="ui header" style="font-size: 1.7em;">Learn how to build your own Hong Kong</h2>
                        <p>The CryptoCountries application runs on the Ethereum network and utilizes smart contracts with individual erc721 tokens (with each being known as a “Smart Contract”) to allow users to buy and own unique, one-of-a-kind Hong Kong Land and property Smart Contracts.
                            <br>
                            <br>Throughout these Terms of Service, the Smart Contracts and the Site hosting the game will be known as the “Game”.
                            <br>
                            <br>By choosing to use the Game, users can purchase and own Hong Kong Land Smart Contracts. CryptoHongKong is making the Game available to you. Prior to using the Game, you must agree to these Terms of Service.
                            <br>
                            <br>Read the following Terms of Service carefully and thoroughly prior to using the Game, purchasing Smart Contracts, or using the Site. Unless we have a separate, written agreement with you that differs from the below Terms of Service, the following Terms of Service absolutely and unequivocally govern your use of the Site, purchase of Smart Contracts, and ownership of Smart Contracts. We will only allow you to use this Site, own Smart Contracts, and/or purchase Smart Contracts if you accept all of these Terms of Service.
                            <br>
                            <br>By using this Game, this Site, and/or these Smart Contracts, or by clicking “agree”, you confirm that you understand these Terms and accept these Terms. In the event that you are using this Site, this Game, or these Smart Contracts on behalf of another company or legal entity, you indicate that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms on the other party’s behalf, and that any mention of “you” in this contract means the other party that you represent. If you do not have the authority to represent another party, then you do not have permission to use this Game, this Site, or these Smart Contracts.
                            <p>
                                <br>
                                <br>1. WE DO NOT ACCEPT DEPOSITS
                                <br>
                                <br>CryptoHongKong.io is a UI interface which allows you to interact directly with a blockcahin smart contract on the ethereum network using the “Metamask” browser extension. The website and it’s creators do not except or hold any payments from players. Any ether transfers done over the website’s are transferred directly to blockchain contract address: (contract address) Any Ether or fiat currency deposited into your metamask extension is fully owned and controlled by the player. The game does not have access to the funds deposited in your metamask browser extension. Transfers of Ether, are passed directly from your metamask account to a smart contract on the ethereum network. Since the game does not except your deposits and does not have any control over it, the game and it’s creators are not liable for any damages or lost of funds.</p>
                            <p>2. PLAY RESPONSIBLY
                                <br>
                                <br>This game allows you to buy and collect digital assets. There is no guarantee that other players or anyone else will buy these assets from you. While some players speculate about their ability to resell their digital assets for a higher value in the future, there is no guarantee that another person will decide to buy your digital asset. If you you choose to transfer ETH in exchange for the ERC721 referred to in the game as “smart contract”, you must accept and understand the risk of potentially not being able to sell your “smart contract” in the future. The game is designed for collectors who choose to pay for the ownership of a digital product referred to as a “smart contracts”. If you choose to speculate over the future value and liquidity of your asset, you must do so at your own risk and not hold the creators of the game or the smart contract liable for any loss or damages. Play responsibly and do not spend more than you feel the digital asset is worth.</p>
                            <p>3. SMART CONTRACTS
                                <br>
                                <br>We have used the district name of Hong Kong to create unique, one-of-a-kind “Smart Contracts” which are represented by ERC721 tokens on the Ethereum BlockChain. These “Smart Contracts” are not endorsed or supported by the person appearing on the card. New Hong Kong Land Smart Contracts will be released as we deem fit. Each land Smart Contract may be purchased by you utilizing ether. You may purchase any land Smart Contract you choose, and any other party may purchase a land Smart Contract that you currently own if the other party is willing to pay a higher sum. The price of the tokens are hard coded into the smart contract itself and can not be changed by anyone, including the games creators. You may not stop another party from purchasing a land Smart Contract that you currently own, and no other third party may stop you from purchasing a land Smart Contract that you wish to own. Whichever party is willing to pay the cost of the land Smart Contract may own said Smart Contract after he or she completes the transaction.</p>
                            <p>4. THE GAME
                                <br>
                                <br>This Game requires that you utilize a Google Chrome or Firefox web browser that currently has a MetaMask browser extension installed. MetaMask is an electronic wallet created by a third party that allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You may not use any other electronic wallet on the Game other than MetaMask; however, you can use other electronic wallets and third-party applications to transfer funds to your MetaMask wallet in order to make purchases and receive payment on the Game. If you do not log on to the Game with the correct browser (either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) and/or if the browser does not have the MetaMask extension installed, you will be recognized by the Game, but you will not be able to interact with the Game in any way. Any and all transactions that take place in the Game occur via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that by using the Game, your Ethereum public address will be made visible to other users of the Game as well as third parties each and every time you engage in a transaction on the Game. We do not own and we do not control any of the following third-party products used for the function of this Game: MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or the Ethereum network. We do not own and we do not control any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit, or use for the purpose of interacting with or using the Game. We will not be held liable, and are not liable, for the acts or omissions by any such third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned third parties.

                                <br>
                                <br>If you choose to purchase any land Smart Contract” on the Game, any and all transactions will be conducted through the Ethereum network utilizing a MetaMask electronic wallet directly to a Smart Contract on the blockchain, which is not controlled by the games creators. We will not have any insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor will we be able to reverse any transaction that occurs. Because of this, we will have no liability to you or any other third party for any claims or damages that may occur due to any transaction that takes place on the Game and/or in regards to any of the country Smart Contracts that we have created. The Ethereum network requires that you pay a transaction fee, commonly known as “Gas”, for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. Gas is intended to fund the hardware and software that runs the Ethereum network, as well as to prevent misuse and spam. If you choose to interact with the Game via our Site or without using the Game or our Site as a portal, you will still need to pay fee for any and every transaction you make on the Ethereum network. The smart contract keeps a 1-5% commission fee on every transaction conducted through it, in addition to the Gas charged by the Ethereum network. The creators of this website and game do not have access or control over these fees, as it is handled directly on the distributed blockcahin network. WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYMENTS DIRECTLY ON OUR WEBSITE.</p>
